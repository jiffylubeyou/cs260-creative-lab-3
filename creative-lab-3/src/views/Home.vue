    <h1>Welcome to Kenny's online sandwich shop, SubbySubs</h1>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And yes the logo above is mine and doesn't belong to another company</p>
    <p>Here at SubbySubs, we rival amazon in our ability to max your credit card send you crap you don't need. We are an online sandwich company that lets you custom tailor a sandwich and have it sent to your very own home/workspace. We have been in the business for some time now and we'll get you the sandwich you want in no time flat.</p>
    <p>SubbySubs is quick and affordable, but keep in mind that we don't necessarily adhere to all current FDA regulations as it creates a number of financial strains. We also do not claim full compliance to child labor laws listed under FLSA and do not claim complete comliance with all humitarian standards set forth by the geneva conventions. We are also legally required to note that we were publically denounced by NATO and technically a "threat to national security".</p>
    <p> Go ahead and get started with the Make a sandwich button up top! Feel free to order anything!</p>
